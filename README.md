# TCS-Stock-Analysis-python
Project Summary:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical TCS stock data to identify trends, patterns, and seasonal behavior using moving averages and correlation analysis.

Engineered features including lag variables, date-time attributes, and calculated moving average crossovers for trend detection.

Built predictive models using Linear Regression for stock price forecasting, evaluated using MSE and RÂ² metrics.

Developed a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model for sequential time series prediction, improving forecast accuracy.

Visualized actual vs predicted stock prices for performance validation, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~69.5 on test data.
